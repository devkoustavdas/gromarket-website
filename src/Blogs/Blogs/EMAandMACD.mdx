## What is a **_MACD indicator_** and what is the theory behind it?

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security’s price.

All of the data used by MACD calculations is based on the historical price action. As a result, it “lags” the price. Hence, Moving Average Convergence Divergence is classified as a _lagging indicator_. The MACD indicator is calculated by subtracting a long-term exponential moving average of 26 periods from a short-term exponential moving average of 12 periods.

It is used to identify trend reversals and momentum shifts in financial markets by comparing moving averages.

## What is a EMA indicator and what is the theory behind it?

Unlike traditional moving averages, Exponential moving average (EMA) gives more weight to recent price data, making it particularly useful for detecting trend changes swiftly. The exponential moving average is also referred to as the exponentially weighted moving average.

It is used to identify trends and potential price reversals in financial markets by placing greater weight on more recent data points.

## Which EMA indicator to use in TradingView?

Search for **_TonyUS EMA Scalper - Buy/Sell_** by **Tus**. Set the period to 26, and you're good to go. The red line is the highest close of the previous 8 bars (resistance). The green line is the lowest close of the previous 8 bars (support).

##How to use the MACD and EMA to trade?

### *   Timeframe

Choose a timeframe that aligns with your trading style and preferences, such as **1-minute, 2-minute, 3-minute, 5-minute, 10-minute, or 15-minute** intervals. I would gor for a 1-minute timeframe for the trade.

### *   Identifying Entry and Exit Points of the MACD & EMA Strategy

Keep a close watch on the crossover between the MACD blue line (Impulse MACD) and the orange signal line on the **_Impulse MACD_**. _After the crossover, if the blue line crosses above the orange line and if in the **_TonyUS EMA Scalper_** the price is above the EMA line, it signals an uptrend and a potential entry point._

Conversely, a crossover of the blue line in the **_Impulse MACD_** below the orange line, coupled with the price dipping below the EMA, suggests a downtrend and a possible exit point.

### *   Spotting Breakouts

In the **_Impulse MACD_** look for situations when MACD blue and orange lines remain consistently above the zero line for an extended period. This signifies a _buildup of momentum, indicating at an upcoming breakout_. Pay attention to histogram crossovers as well. A crossover above the zero line indicates increasing bullish momentum, while a crossover below the zero line signals increasing bearish momentum.

### *   Support and Resistances

The red line of the TonyUS EMA Scalper indicator represents resistance, while the green line denotes support. Use these levels to estimate potential price reversals or breakout confirmations.

Mastering the art of intraday trading requires not only skill, but also the correct tools and methods at hand. By combining the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator and the Exponential Moving Average (EMA), you gain a significant advantage in handling the volatile landscape of intraday trading. The MACD's capacity to detect trend reversals and momentum shifts, combined with the EMA's quick responsiveness to price movements, is the foundation of a successful intraday trading approach. By attentively watching crossovers, breakouts, and support/resistance levels, you may precisely identify optimal entry and exit opportunities, maximising profit potential while minimising risk.
