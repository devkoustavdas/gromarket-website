The New Tax Regime is the default tax regime from this year, as per the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2023 in Section 115BAC. For individuals, HUFs, AOPs, BOIs, and AJPs, the new tax regime will apply by default. However, those who prefer the old tax regime, they must explicitly choose to opt-out of Section 115BAC(6)</li><li>For individuals with income (excluding income from a business or profession) need to specify their preferred tax regime in the income tax return filed for the relevant assessment year under Section 139(1) For individuals with income from a business or profession, the option to opt out of the new tax regime and revert to the old tax regime is available. To exercise this choice, they must submit Form No. 10-IEA on or before the due date for filing the income tax return under Section 139(1).</li><li>An additional section, <strong>Section 80CCH</strong>, has been introduced by the Finance Act 2023. This section specifies that individuals who enroll in the Agnipath Scheme and subscribe to the Agniveer Corpus Fund on or after 01-11-2022 are entitled to a tax deduction for the entire amount deposited in the Agniveer Corpus Fund. To accommodate this change, ITR forms 1 has been updated to incorporate a new column which allows taxpayers to provide the relevant details regarding the amount eligible for deduction under Section 80CCH.</li></ul>
