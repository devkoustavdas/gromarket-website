Vimal felt relieved when he landed his first job. His offer letter included a **₹2 lakh corporate (company) health cover** for his spouse and parents. He thought he was "sorted."

Two years later, reality hit. His father required three surgeries for kidney stones. The bill? **₹4.5 lakhs**. Because Vimal’s corporate cover capped out at ₹2 lakh, he had to *drain his emergency savings to pay the remaining ₹2.5 lakhs.* 

This is the **"Corporate Insurance Trap."** Unfortunately, it is a common scenario these days. Most people do not buy health insurance as they rely too much on their employer’s health insurance coverage.  With medical inflation in India hitting **14-15% annually**, a basic employer plan is no longer a safety net—it’s just a bandage.

## How Does Corporate Health Insurance Work?

In simple terms, it is a type of health insurance policy that the employer provides to its employees. It offers them the optimum health coverage they require:

- It generally includes your spouse and children. However, some corporate health plans extend coverage to parents as well
- Usually, it provides a fixed sum insured amount that covers the cost of hospitalization in the event of an illness or accident. The hospitalization should be for more than 24 hours
- To increase your sum insured amount you would need to pay an additional premium

## The "Sweet" Part: Why We Love Corporate Plans (The Pros!)

- **No Waiting Period (Day 1 Coverage):** Waiver of the waiting period is one of the biggest advantages that it offers. Usually, a waiting period of 2 to 4 years applies to pre-existing diseases (PED), certain specified medical conditions, and maternity benefits in any Medical Insurances. In this case, the employee gets coverage right from the inception of the policy.

- **No-Medical Checkup:** The policy is issued without undergoing a pre-medical screening, even for senior citizens. In other health plans, a pre-medical test may be required depending on your age, and pre-existing medical conditions.

- **Premium is Taken Care Off:** The premium is paid by your employer. Only if you plan to increase the sum assured or top it up with another health plan, you would need to pay the difference.

## 10 Reasons Why Your Corporate Plan is NOT Enough (The Cons!)

To help you make an informed decision, here are some reasons why your corporate health insurance plan may not suffice, and why you may need to enhance it with an additional health insurance cover?

- **The "Job Loss" Vulnerability:** Your coverage is tied to your employee ID. If you resign, get laid off, or the company faces a downturn, you and your family are **uninsured** the very next day. If a medical emergency strikes during your "notice period" or job hunt, you’re on your own.

- **Low Sum Insured vs. Medical Inflation:** Group medical plans that are taken by most employers have a limited coverage amount. The maximum coverage could likely be up to Rs. 5,00,000 (if you are lucky). And if we look at the cost of medical treatment in case of a serious illness, this amount would only make up for 25% to 35% of the total expenditure. Today, a single heart procedure or a week in the ICU can easily cross ₹8-10 lakhs in private hospitals. So, why pay from your own pocket if you have an insurance cover?

- **The Co-Payment Clause:** It implies that a fixed percentage of the medical bill needs to be paid by the policyholder. Many employer plans (especially for parents) have a 20-40% co-pay. This means even if your claim is approved, you are legally bound to pay nearly half the bill from your pocket.

- **Room Rent Capping:** Most corporate plans limit your room rent to 1% of the sum insured (e.g., ₹2,000 for a ₹2 lakh policy). If you pick a room that costs ₹5,000, the insurer won’t just ask you to pay the ₹3,000 difference, they will proportionally reduce your entire bill payout.

- **Number of Insured Members:** Not all employer health insurance plans offer coverage to your dependent family members. It is one of the major shortcomings of this plan. The whole idea of buying a health cover is to secure your loved ones along with you in case of a hospitalization. And if you have your spouse, children, and elderly parents dependent on you, then corporate health plans might not be adequate.

- **No Global Coverage:** Planning a trip abroad or seeking a second opinion from a specialist in the US? Corporate plans are almost strictly limited to Indian borders.

- **No "No Claim Bonus" (NCB):** Individual plans reward you for healthy years by increasing your cover (up to 100%) at no extra cost. Corporate plans are static; they don't grow with you.

- **Tax Benefits (Section 80D):** Since your employer pays the premium for the group plan, you don't get the **tax deduction**. By paying for a personal policy, you can save up to ₹25,000 (for self/family) and an additional ₹50,000 (for senior citizen parents) in taxes.

- **Lack of Post-Retirement Security:** You are most likely to need insurance after 60. However, buying a fresh policy at 60 is nearly impossible or incredibly expensive. Starting a personal policy while you are young (and healthy) locks in your insurability for life.

- **Diagnostic & OPD Gaps:** Most corporate plans only cover "In-patient" (24-hour hospitalization). The thousands of rupees spent on MRIs, blood tests, and specialist consultations (OPD) usually aren't covered.

## What Should You Do? The "Hybrid" Strategy

Don't ditch your corporate plan, rather augment it.

- **Keep the Corporate Cover:** Use it for minor issues or as the "first line of defense."

- **Buy a "Super Top-Up" Policy:** This is a high-cover policy with a "deductible." It’s very cheap and kicks in once your corporate limit is exhausted.

- **Get a Base Individual Plan:** A ₹5-10 lakh personal plan ensures you stay covered even when you change jobs.

### Questions to get answers today:

- *Is your total family cover less than ₹10 Lakhs?*

- *Does your policy have a room rent limit?*

- *Would you be uninsured if you quit today?*

If you answered YES to any of these, you are not fully insured. It's high time you take steps to fix it.
