Vimal joined his first company. He was feeling a bit relieved as the company he started working with provides him a health insurance cover of  ₹2 lakh. The policy also covers his spouse and dependent parents. For 2 years he has been working in the same organization and has never been in a situation where he had to claim his corporate health insurance policy.

But in the third year, his father was diagnosed with Kidney Stones and had to go under urgent surgery for removal of them. Due to some issues I had to go under surgery total of 3 times in a time span of 2 months. Even though all surgeries were non-invasive and I was given leave within 2 days every time. The total amount was approximately ₹4.5 Lakh.

It came as a setback to him as his employer insurance policy had a coverage limit of ₹2 lakh and the total expense came out to be double that. So, he had to pay ₹2.5 lakhs amount from his pocket, which he could have saved if he had a separate health insurance cover with an adequate sum insured amount in addition to his corporate health plan.

Unfortunately, it is a common scenario these days. Most people do not buy health insurance as they rely too much on their employer’s health insurance coverage.

_The question is can one afford to miss out on health insurance especially with the healthcare inflation rising at an alarming rate?_

## How Does Corporate Health Insurance Work?

In simple terms, it is a type of health insurance policy that the employer provides to its employees. It offers them the optimum health coverage they require:

-   It generally includes your spouse and children. However, some corporate health plans extend coverage to parents as well
-   Usually, it provides a fixed sum insured amount that covers the cost of hospitalization in the event of an illness or accident. The hospitalization should be for more than 24 hours
-   To increase your sum insured amount you would need to pay an additional premium

## The Pros of a Corporate Health Plan

-   **Waiting Period**

Waiver of the waiting period is one of the biggest advantages that it offers. Usually, a waiting period of 2 to 4 years applies to pre-existing illnesses, certain specified medical conditions, and maternity benefits. In this case, the employee gets coverage right from the inception of the policy.

-   **Pre-Existing Diseases**

When it comes to corporate health plans, most of the claims are accepted despite any pre-existing illnesses (that you might have before getting insured). It is another advantage, as many insurers may deny claims or coverage or will have a waiting period clause in such cases. You can always check with your employer to be sure.

-   **No-Medical Checkup**

The policy is issued without undergoing a pre-medical screening, even for senior citizens. In other health plans, a pre-medical test may be required depending on your age, and pre-existing medical conditions.

-   **Premium is Taken Care Off**

The premium is paid by your employer. Only if you plan to increase the sum assured or top it up with another health plan, you would need to pay the difference.

## The Cons of a Corporate Health Plan

To help you make an informed decision, here are some reasons why your corporate health insurance plan may not suffice, and why you may need to enhance it with an additional health insurance cover?

-   **Coverage Amount**

Group medical plans that are taken by most employers have a limited sum assured amount. The maximum coverage could likely be up to Rs. 5,00,000 (if you are lucky).

And if we look at the cost of medical treatment in case of a serious illness, this amount would only make up for 25 to 35 percent of the total expenditure. So, why pay from your own pocket if you have an insurance cover?

-   **Co-Payment Clause**

It implies that a fixed percentage of the medical bill needs to be paid by the policyholder. In this case, the insurance company will only pay a percentage of the sum insured amount. For example, the insurer will pay 80% of the total expenses, and you need to shell out 20% from your bank account, and in some cases, it can be as high as 40%.

Most insurance policies do not have a co-pay clause, unless it is for a senior citizen, and also give you the liberty to opt out of it (if there is any). You can always select an individual health plan without a co-pay or minimum co-pay.

-   **Room Rent Capping**

It is also referred to as a sub-limit on hospital room rent. So, in a corporate health plan, the permissible room rent limit is pre-defined. And if you opt for a room with a higher tariff, then you will need to foot the difference.

-   **Policy Tenure**

Your corporate health insurance will offer coverage until you are employed with the organization. The moment your employment ends, the policy will be terminated. You will be out of insurance cover, till you get employed somewhere else.

-   **Number of Insured Members**

Not all employer health insurance plans offer coverage to your dependent family members. It is one of the major shortcomings of this plan. The whole idea of buying a health cover is to secure your loved ones along with you in case of a hospitalization. And if you have your spouse, children, and elderly parents dependent on you, then corporate health plans might not be adequate.


**3. Does it provide global cover?**

Global cover refers to medical expenses that are incurred outside India if the diagnosis was made in India. You need to consider if they cover only inpatient hospitalisation costs or if OPD treatment is covered too. You might also need to look at the countries that come under such a plan and the method of payment - is it cashless or on a reimbursement basis?

**5. Does it cover diagnostic tests?**

Diagnostic tests may be subject to sub-limits, in which case an employee may have to foot the bill from their own resources. This includes common pathological tests and specialised tests such as MRI, which can prove to be an expensive proposition.
